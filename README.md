This script automates the otherwise complex task of cloning and binding the Swiss Ephemeris on any system with Bash installed. Using a natively bound Swiss Ephemeris offers several key advantages over existing crates and libraries:

    Maximum Performance – Direct bindings ensure API calls are as fast as possible, with 100% of the Swiss Ephemeris functions and constants available.
    Comprehensive Documentation – Readable bindings and constants are provided in bindings.rs and sweph.h, unlike many existing crates, which often lack proper documentation.
